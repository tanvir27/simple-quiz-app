            <h3 class="mb-3 text-primary">1. Difference Between Map(), find(), filter() and forEach () Method </h3>
            <p class="fs-5">
              *  The map() is used to transform an array by applying a function to each element in the array and returning a new array with the transformed values. It returns a new array and he original array remains unchanged.
                 <br>
              *  The filter() is used to create a new array with all the elements that pass a certain condition specified by a callback function. But It returns a new array with the filtered values. 
                <br>
              *  When we use find method it find the first element in an array that satisfies a certain condition specified by a callback function. It returns a value by checking condition. If the condition is true and found several element then it returns first element otherwise it returns  undefined.
                <br>
              *  The forEach () is used to loop over an array. It execute a callback function on each element in the array. ForEach() does not return anything. But it can modify the original array.

                2. Difference between Local storage, sesssion storage, cookies
            </h3>
            <p class="fs-5">
               <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Local storage is a client-side storage option that allows web applications to store data in the browser beyond the current session. The data is stored permanently and it remains available even after the browser is closed and reopened. 
                <br>
                <strong>Session Storage:</strong>  Session storage is another client-side storage option that allows web applications to store data in the browser, but it's not permanently store the data. It store only for the duration of the session. The data is lost once when the browser tab or window is closed.
                <br>
                <strong>Cookies: </strong> Cookies are pieces of data that are kept on user computer as a little text files. The connection is cut off once a web server sends a web page to a browser, and the server loses all memory of the user.

                3. What is EventLoop ? How it Works ?
            </h3>
            <p class=" fs-5">
                 Event Loop is a key concept of JavaScript. It is responsible for handling asynchronous operations in language. 
                 Basically  Event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle multiple operations at the same time, without blocking the main thread.
                <br>
                It works by shifting asynchronous activities to a task queue and their related callbacks to a callback queue, and then continuously monitoring both queues to run functions when the stack fills up.
