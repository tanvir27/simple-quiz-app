                    <p class="fs-5">
                      *  The map() is used to transform an array by applying a function to each element in the array and returning a new array with the transformed values. It returns a new array and he original array remains unchanged.
                         <br>
                      *  The filter() is used to create a new array with all the elements that pass a certain condition specified by a callback function. But It returns a new array with the filtered values. 
                        <br>
                      *  When we use find method it find the first element in an array that satisfies a certain condition specified by a callback function. It returns a value by checking condition. If the condition is true and found several element then it returns first element otherwise it returns  undefined.
                        <br>
                      *  The forEach () is used to loop over an array. It execute a callback function on each element in the array. ForEach() does not return anything. But it can modify the original array.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="fs-5">
                       <strong>Local Storage:</strong> Local storage is a client-side storage option that allows web applications to store data in the browser beyond the current session. The data is stored permanently and it remains available even after the browser is closed and reopened. 
                        <br>
                        <strong>Session Storage:</strong>  Session storage is another client-side storage option that allows web applications to store data in the browser, but it's not permanently store the data. It store only for the duration of the session. The data is lost once when the browser tab or window is closed.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Cookies: </strong> Cookies are pieces of data that are kept on user computer as a little text files. The connection is cut off once a web server sends a web page to a browser, and the server loses all memory of the user.

                        3. What is EventLoop ? How it Works ?
                    </h3>
                    <p class=" fs-5">
                         Event Loop is a key concept of JavaScript. It is responsible for handling asynchronous operations in language. 
                         Basically  Event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle multiple operations at the same time, without blocking the main thread.
                        <br>
                        It works by shifting asynchronous activities to a task queue and their related callbacks to a callback queue, and then continuously monitoring both queues to run functions when the stack fills up.

                <div class="mx-auto mt-4">
                    <h2 class="mb-3 text-primary">1. quizTimer(): </h2>
                 <p class="fs-5">
                    Basically quizTimer() is mainly used to display a quiz time. This function counts a duration and starts a timer. The function is made to take a parameter name <strong>dismiss</strong>. If <strong>dismiss</strong> is true, the timer is stopped by calling clearInterval() function. If not true, then an interval function setInterval() is called. <br>
                    The setInterval() function runs once per second (1 second), replacing the code block. The time is counted and the value is incremented. The time is changed in minutes and seconds and displayed via the HTML element. If the count is grater then 60, then it check another condition that is if the remainder of count divided by 2 is equal to 0. If the condition is true, then it remove the css clss 'text-red-300' and added the css class 'text-red-700' from the classList of the <strong>countHtml</strong>. <br>
                    But  If the condition of the second if statement is false, then the code inside the else block will be executed. And here firstly remove the css class 'text-red-700' and then it added the css class 'text-red-300' from the classList of the <strong>countHtml.</strong> 
                 </p>
                    
                </div>
        
                <div class="mx-auto mt-4">
                    <h2 class="mb-3 text-primary">2. chooseQuiz(): </h2>
                 <p class="fs-5">
                   Firstly, this chooseQuiz() function that takes in two parameters taht is index and givenAns. After that declare a variable name isExist that uses find() method to search through an array called answers. The find() method checks each element of the array to see if it matches the condition specified in the callback function. Then it checks if the id property of the current element of answers is equal to the id property of the element in the quizData array at the specified index.
                   <br>
                   After that it check another if condition that is if isExist is truthy value then it execute otherwise else condition execute. Inner this if condition, here declare a variable name serial = 0 and also starts for of loop that iterates over each element of the <strong>'answers'</strong> array. Inner for of loop here is another if else condition. In this case if contidion check if <strong>'isExist.id === quiz.id'</strong> then <strong>splice()</strong> method is used to replace the element at index serial with a new object that includes the quiz data at the specified index and the givenAns parameter. After that the loop is break by using break statement. 
                   
                   <br>
                   But if condition is not equal or not true then else condition execute and inner else contidion it adds a new object to the end of the answers array that includes the quiz data at the specified index and the givenAns parameter.
                   
                   <br>
                   Lastly, <strong>displayAnswer(answer)</strong> function called and passes in the answer array as a parameter.
                 </p>
